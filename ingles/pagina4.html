                When it comes to marine life, it is about who dies from the pollution that we humans not only on the beaches, but also in the rivers that flow into them on the beaches, we cannot fail to preserve marine life... <br>

                We must take care of what we use for leisure and not let too much garbage pollute the seas or our beaches.

                <h2>Pollution</h2>
        
            <p>
                Ecological: Oil does not allow sunlight to penetrate seawater, disrupts photosynthesis in marine vegetation, causes imbalances in the food chain, kills large fish, harms fishing activities, etc. An example of marine pollution caused by oil spills is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The explosion was responsible for the biggest environmental accident caused by US oil. The release into the sea of about 7 million liters of oil led to the formation of large oil slicks in this environment. The decline of marine fish stocks is a recent and important phenomenon. The reasons for this are human activities, mainly overfishing and overfishing, and other human encroachments on the environment such as global warming and pollution.

            <h2>Pollution by Ships</h2>
        
            <p>
                The problem of marine pollution, whatever it may be, only arises when an environmental disaster occurs. There is no need for very in-depth data or research on the subject to understand the extent of environmental degradation. We just look around. As the environmental conditions on land are also far from perfect, the garbage thrown directly into the sea has an impact not only on marine life, but also on the various wastes thrown on the streets every day, for example, taken to the sea through sewers. . In addition to these wrecks, the sea faces an even more formidable enemy: the giants of the sea, estimated at over 50,000 ships worldwide, and the number gradually increases each year. And they do as much damage as themselves.

            <p>
                The ocean is currently the final repository for large amounts of toxic waste and sewage. Modern society, especially Western society, is characterized by the massive production of non-biodegradable waste, of which plastics stand out, floating in the waters of the entire planet or deposited at the bottom. These objects remain in the environment for long periods of time, in some cases centuries, before being decomposed by natural processes. Basically, they cause dramatic changes in the physical properties of the environment and bury the flora and fauna. They can also be mistaken for food by fish and eventually die after being eaten. Microplastics are already present throughout the marine food chain, taken up by microbes and then transmitted to larger organisms.
