                Who doesn't love discovering idyllic beaches around the world? Or relax and dive into clean, crystal clear waters? But with the increase of human presence and actions, many beaches are suffering from pollution, garbage, risks for marine life and, of course, for us too. Taking care of beaches is just part of the process to help save our oceans. This is because 80% of the garbage that reaches the seas comes from cities and travels a long distance to reach them. But it is a good start, and actions that we, individually, can take immediately.
                
                Let's do our part? See these tips below. They are as valid for your day to day as for when you are traveling. Are you already a fan of them? How about multiplying them?
