				What is needed to control and reduce marine pollution?
			</h2>
			<div class="meio1">
				<p class="escmeio">
					Marine pollution is a growing problem around the world, which is systematically increasing every year due to the irregular disposal of different types of waste and the lack of sustainable measures. Because of ocean pollution, the question can and should be asked: what exactly is needed to control and reduce ocean pollution? Know that the answer to this question is very broad and depends on collective action, on the unity of all. The current situation of marine pollution is catastrophic, but from an environmental point of view it can be reversed or at least mitigated by more responsible measures. For change to occur, two pillars are fundamental: people and companies.

						PUBLISH EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGNS ON THE THEME
					</h2>
					<p class="escmeio2">
						To encourage changes in attitudes regarding waste disposal, many programs, such as Recicla, promote campaigns that induce reflection on the most appropriate behavior in relation to the destination of the waste produced, providing quality education on the subject. Give that strength to your network!
					</p>
					<h2 class="tmeio">
						BRING A BAG TO STORE YOUR GARBAGE
					</h2>
				<p class="escmeio2">
					It is important to collect all the garbage produced by your family during the tour, so don't forget to separate a bag for this function before going to the beach. If it's made of biodegradable material, even better! In this way, the environmental impact will be less.
					When leaving the beach, if the trash bins provided by the city hall or by the merchants are too full, don't throw your bag over everything. Take it home and find a suitable location.
					If you are a smoker, never discard butts in the sand, much less in aluminum cans or glass bottles. This can harm or even make it impossible to recycle items. Take a specific container and if there is no collection point for recycling butts, dispose of it in the regular trash. Research indicates that butts are champions of incorrect disposal in the country.

					Attitudes that help prevent pollution of beaches and oceans
				</h1>
				<p class="escrita1">1- Use reusable water bottles instead of PET bottles. Plastic is one of the biggest environmental problems in the ocean, harmful to fauna and causing enormous damage to ecosystems. One of the main pollutants in the ocean</p>
				<hr>
				<p class="escrita1">2- Write to politicians and leaders in your area about initiatives that can prevent your city's pollutants from entering the ocean. 3- There is a program called Sing Up to Clean Up. The plan, which includes cleaning up beaches, covers several countries, including Brazil. But if you avoid throwing your garbage in the sea while on vacation, you've already contributed.</p>
				<hr>
				<p class="escrita1">3- If you are a smoker, use a cigarette butt or cigarette holder. Cigarette butts are not biodegradable and are a major environmental concern. Find out more in "Cigarette butts: a great environmental villain".</p>
				<hr>
				<p class="escrita1">4- Separate recyclable waste. Acquiring this habit would be a big step towards contributing to the environment..</p>
				<hr>
				<p class="escrita1">5- Use a coffee mug or water mug at work, picnic items, and reusable shopping bags. Items that can be reused countless times prevent excessive consumption and disposal of materials.</p>
				<hr>
				<p class="escrita1">6- Buy less. This reduces the amount of crafted items that end up in the seas.</p>
				<hr>
				<p class="escrita1">7- Last but not least, send emails to companies asking them to reduce the volume of their packaging and create new ones that are biodegradable.</p>
